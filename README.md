# 100 Days of ML and DL

## Day 1: September 29, 2018

**Today's Progress :** I decided to work on a competition hosted on [Driven Data](https://www.drivendata.org/) where we have to Predict about Blood Donations.   

**Conclusion :** I have solved the problem and I'm in top 33% in leaderboard. In this problem i learnt about roc curve, auc and how to train small dataset because it can easily overfit on any algorithm.
